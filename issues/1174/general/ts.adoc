==== Gabon (country code +241)

===== Communications of 21.V.2019 and 27.V.2019

The _Autorité de Régulation des Communications Electroniques et des Postes_,
Libreville, in collaboration with all operators, will migrate,
*on Friday, 12 July 2019 at 2300 hours GMT, i.e. 2400 hours local time,*
its eight (8)-digit national numbering plan, currently structured ABPQMCDU, to nine (9) digits.

This operation is designed to provide a solution to the imminent saturation of the existing plan and comply with related international rules which recommend suppression of the zero (0) for incoming international calls.

====== 1 OVERALL STRUCTURE OF NEW NUMBERING PLAN

Whereas the _existing_ eight (8)-digit plan is structured AB PQMCDU, the new plan employs nine (9) digits structured *AX BPQMCDU,* with the addition of digit *X* between the *A* and *B*.

The new identifiers take the form *AX* with *A= 0* and;

• *X = 1:* for Gabon Télécom's fixed network*;*

• *X = 2: 3, 4, 5* in reserve*;*

• *X = 6:* for Gabon Télécom's mobile network (Libertis and Moov);

• *X = 7:* for Airtel Gabon's mobile network;

• *X = 8:* for value-added services;

• *X = 9:* reserved for the Gabonese Administration (RAG).
